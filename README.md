# water-video-pi
Connecting water flow sensors with Raspberry Pi GPIO and use it to control the playback of the videos

- Switching between two videos using a single video file by skipping to different time in the video
- Smoothing the water flow sensor data by counting pulses within a window frame (CONS: causing a bit of delay..)
